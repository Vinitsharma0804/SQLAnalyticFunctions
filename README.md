# SQLAnalyticFunctions
Analytic functions are a powerful feature in SQL, combining aggregation capabilities with advanced
row-by-row calculations using the Over clause. The Over clause often consists of analytic clauses like
Partition By, Order By, and the windowing clause. Itâ€™s important to distinguish between analytic and
aggregate functions: if an aggregate function (like Sum, Avg, etc.) is followed by an Over clause, it
becomes an analytic function.
